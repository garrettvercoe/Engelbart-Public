🚀 Getting Started

To join Engelbart on his crazy adventures into Twitter, you'll have to follow these steps.

1. **Get the code**
⋅⋅⋅In your terminal, clone this repo.
```git clone git@github.com:garrettvercoe/Engelbart-Public.git```

2. **Getting Credentials**
⋅⋅⋅Since Engelbart pulls directly from Twitter, you'll need to be authenticated on Twitter.  Head over to the [Application management on Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) to create an application.
⋅⋅⋅Once you've created your application, click on the Keys and access tokens tab to retrieve `your consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token` and `access_token_secret`.

⚡️ Running Engelbart
---
```cd Engelbart-Public```
```docker-compose build```
We use Docker for ensuring a stable build across platforms. This will install the dependencies for this project on a virtual machine that will run the app.
```docker-compose up```
This should start 4 containers, which gets our frontend and backend working together and linked up. 
Once the last command has been started up, visit `http://localhost:5001/` in your browser. You should see Engelbart's loading page.

**Loading Image**

Because the app is being run locally instead of on a dedicated online server, you'll need to give it some time to pull Live tweets before it can visualize them.
Click "Teach Engelbart about Twitter" which will pull live Tweets for 5 minutes, and then give you a link to view those Tweets in Cyberspace.
